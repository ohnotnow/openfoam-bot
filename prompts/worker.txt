We have the following request from the user about an OpenFOAM simulation:

<request>{{ requirements }}</request>

{% if project_description %}
    The users overall project is as follows:

    <project>
    {{ project_description }}
    </project>
{% endif %}

We have the following specification from our Advisor LLM:

<specification>{{ specification }}</specification>

YOUR TASK: Generate the necessary OpenFOAM folders/files (system, constant, 0) for a minimal but valid case.

- Include controlDict, fvSchemes, fvSolution under system.
- Include turbulence-related files under constant/ (e.g., turbulenceProperties, thermophysicalProperties, transportProperties).
- Include 0/U, 0/p, 0/T (if needed), with boundary conditions matching the plan above.
- Use placeholders if needed (e.g., for mesh generation), but keep everything consistent with the solver and turbulence model.
- Make sure the contents of the file are valid OpenFOAM files - do not interpret them as JSON or YAML - use OpenFOAM conventions.  The contents will be used directly in a simulation so incorrect file contents will break the users HPC cluster.

Your response should be in and XML-like format following the following structure:

<files>
    <file path="system/controlDict">Contents of controlDict</file>
    <file path="system/fvSchemes">Contents of fvSchemes</file>
    ...
    <file path="0/U">Contents of 0/U</file>
    <file path="0/p">Contents of 0/p</file>
    ...
</files>
