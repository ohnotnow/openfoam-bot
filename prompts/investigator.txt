The user is doing a PhD in Aerospace engineering and has provided the following problem statement about an OpenFOAM simulation:

<requirements>{{ requirements }}</requirements>

1. Please identify the key parameters and assumptions from the user's description.
2. Check if there are any missing or ambiguous details that we should clarify.
2a. For any missing or ambiguous details - if there are likely 'best guesses' then please make them - we want to make this as useful to the user as possible. You can assume PhD level understanding from the users side.
3. Produce a structured specification (in JSON) that summarizes what we know so far, and clearly list any questions or missing info.

{% if project_description %}
    The users overall project is as follows:

    <project>
    {{ project_description }}
    </project>

    Please take this into account when thinking about the user's problem statement.
{% endif %}

Example response:

{
    "key_parameters": ["density", "viscosity", "temperature"],
    "assumptions": ["constant density", "constant viscosity"],
    "questions": ["What is the temperature of the fluid?"],
}

If you have no questions please just return an empty JSON array for that field.
