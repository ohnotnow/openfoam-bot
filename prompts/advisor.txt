We have a request from the user about creating an OpenFOAM simulation.

<requirements>{{ requirements }}</requirements>

We have the following initial specification from our Investigator LLM:

<specification>{{ specification }}</specification>

{% if answer %}
    The user has provided the following additional information to the Investigator LLM:

    <answer>{{ answer }}</answer>
{% endif %}


{% if project_description %}
    The users overall project is as follows:

    <project>
    {{ project_description }}
    </project>

    Please take this into account when thinking about the user's problem statement.
{% endif %}


Based on this information, please:

1. Recommend which OpenFOAM solver is best suited for a steady, compressible, transonic flow.
2. Advise on relevant boundary conditions (inlet, outlet, far-field, airfoil wall) and how to handle angle of attack.
3. Suggest any best-practice tips for numerical schemes (fvSchemes) and solver controls (fvSolution).
4. Summarize the recommended approach in a concise, structured way that we can pass to a file-generator LLM.

You should return a JSON object as follows:

{
    "solver": "The recommended OpenFOAM solver.",
    "boundary_conditions": "The recommended boundary conditions.",
    "best_practice_tips": "The best-practice tips for numerical schemes and solver controls.",
    "summary": "A summary of the recommended approach.",
}
